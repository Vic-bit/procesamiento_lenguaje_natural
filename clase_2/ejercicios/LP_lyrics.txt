Papercut
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watchin' you too
Right inside your skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin (I feel the light betray me)
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within (I feel the light betray me)

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
(It's like) It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

One Step Closer
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]Just like before[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]Everything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeI'm about to breakEverything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to break[Bridge: Chester Bennington]Shut up when I'm talking to youShut up, shut up, shut upShut up when I'm talking to youShut up, shut up, shut up, shut upI'm about to break[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]Everything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeI'm about to breakEverything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to break

With You
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot about yesterday, remembering
I'm pretendin' to be who I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistakes, slow to react
And even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories, even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong, I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistakes, slow to react
So even though you're close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories, even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come, I
I can't wait to see tomorrow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
With you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

Points of Authority
[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I'll do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)
You love to think you're never wrong (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)


Crawling
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real





[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing




This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem





[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in




Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real





[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting (Distracting), reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection (My own reflection)
It's haunting (It's haunting) how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in




Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real




Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

Confusing what is real



[Outro: Chester Bennington]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming)

Runaway Lyrics
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Graffiti decorations under a sky of dust
A constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me, I learned were never true

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action, these words were never true

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm gonna run away and never say goodbye!
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why!
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind!
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Mind! (Gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind! (Gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind! (Gonna run away, gonna run away)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind






(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling)

By Myself
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade, but then
I just end up gettin' hurt again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch 'em, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Don't you know!?
I can't tell you how to make it go!
No matter what I do, how hard I try!
I can't seem to convince myself why!
I'm stuck on the outside, don't you know?!
I can't tell you how to make it go!
No matter what I do, how hard I try!
I can't seem to convince myself why!
I'm stuck on the outside

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking


In the End
[Intro: Chester Bennington]
It starts with one

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

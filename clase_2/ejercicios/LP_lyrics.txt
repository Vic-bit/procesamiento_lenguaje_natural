Papercut
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watchin' you too
Right inside your skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin (I feel the light betray me)
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within (I feel the light betray me)

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
(It's like) It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

One Step Closer
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]Just like before[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]Everything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeI'm about to breakEverything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to break[Bridge: Chester Bennington]Shut up when I'm talking to youShut up, shut up, shut upShut up when I'm talking to youShut up, shut up, shut up, shut upI'm about to break[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]Everything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeI'm about to breakEverything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to break

With You
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot about yesterday, remembering
I'm pretendin' to be who I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistakes, slow to react
And even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories, even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong, I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistakes, slow to react
So even though you're close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories, even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come, I
I can't wait to see tomorrow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
With you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

Points of Authority
[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I'll do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)
You love to think you're never wrong (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)


Crawling
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real





[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing




This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem





[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in




Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real





[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting (Distracting), reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection (My own reflection)
It's haunting (It's haunting) how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in




Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real




Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

Confusing what is real



[Outro: Chester Bennington]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming)

Runaway Lyrics
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Graffiti decorations under a sky of dust
A constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me, I learned were never true

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action, these words were never true

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm gonna run away and never say goodbye!
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why!
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind!
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Mind! (Gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind! (Gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind! (Gonna run away, gonna run away)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind






(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling)

By Myself
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade, but then
I just end up gettin' hurt again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch 'em, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Don't you know!?
I can't tell you how to make it go!
No matter what I do, how hard I try!
I can't seem to convince myself why!
I'm stuck on the outside, don't you know?!
I can't tell you how to make it go!
No matter what I do, how hard I try!
I can't seem to convince myself why!
I'm stuck on the outside

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking


In the End
[Intro: Chester Bennington]
It starts with one

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter


A Place for My Head
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors, then rapidly
You just turn around and start askin' me about
Things that you want back from me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Maybe someday, I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous, but you shoulda known
That you'd wear out your welcome, and now you see
How quiet it is all alone
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Stay away!
I am so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Stay!)
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (A!)
While I find a place to rest
And I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Way!)
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (Stay away from me!)
While I find a place to rest



Forgotten
[Intro: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
There's a place so dark, you can't see the end
(Skies cock back) And shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut, lookin' through the rust and rot, and dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open, and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Movin' all around, screamin' of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps
Behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
In the memory, you will find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up


Pushing Me Away
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Pushes me away


[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
This is my December
This is my snow-covered home
This is my December
This is me, alone

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things
That I said to you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
These are my snow-covered trees
This is me pretending
This is all I need

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things
That I said to you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to


METEORA

Don’t Stay
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes, I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes, I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow, I need you to go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda & Both]
(Don't stay) Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and don't stay

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes, I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes, I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow, I need to be alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda & Both]
(Don't stay) Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and don't stayI don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day
Of you wasting me away
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day
Of you wasting me away
(With no apologies)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
(When this began) I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothin' to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Lookin' everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothin' to gain, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm
Somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm
Somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong


[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealin' second after second just 'cause I know I can, but

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You
(No, no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you is me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I oughta be
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And now, you think this person really is me
And I'm trying to bend the truth
But the more I push, the more I'm pullin' away
'Cause I'm lying my way from

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You
(No, no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you runnin' from me
Like this, this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you runnin' from me
Like this (This) this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you runnin' from me
Like this (This) this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you runnin' from me
Like this
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You
(No turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me


[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind, afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around
You think havin' the upper hand means you gotta keep puttin' me down
But I've had too many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waitin' until the upper hand is mine

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Makin' your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Makin' your heart stop
You think you won, and then it's all gone

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on
There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall, and I'm countin' down the time
'Cause I've had so many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waitin' until the upper hand is mine

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Makin' your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Makin' your heart stop
You think you won

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
Now it's all gone

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I know I'll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide us, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Makin' your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Makin' your heart stop
You think you won
[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
Now it's all gone


[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Something has been taken from deep inside of me
A secret I've kept locked away, no one can ever see
Wounds so deep they never show, they never go away
Like moving pictures in my head, for years and years they've played

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
Is so much simpler than change

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone
[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's easier to run
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made
It's easier to go
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave


[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

[Breakdown: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored


[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Nothin' ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin'
It's like nothin' I could do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize instead of settin' it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Never goes away
Never goes away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Hearin' your name, the memories come back again
I remember when it started happenin'
I'd see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committin' myself to 'em and every day
I regret sayin' those things 'cause now I see that I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Never goes away
Never goes away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington, Both]
Never goes away
Never goes away
It never goes away
It never goes away (Get away from me)
Gimme my space back, you gotta just (Go)
Everything comes down to memories of (You)
I've kept it in, but now I'm lettin' you (Know)
I've let you go, so get away from me
Gimme my space back, you gotta just (Go)
Everything comes down to memories of (You)
I've kept it in, but now I'm lettin' you (Know)
I've let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've let myself become you
I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you



[Verse 1]
Memories consume like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 2]
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Bridge]
I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight


[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I don't know who to trust, no surprise
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Tryin' not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(I) All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Tension is building inside, steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Tryin' not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(I) All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I won't waste myself on you, you, you
Waste myself on you, you, you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'll take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
Everything from the inside
And just throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you, you, you


[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Com-com-com-com-comin' at you
Com—, at you, com-comin' at you

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, peep the style and the kids checkin' for it
The number one question is "How could you ignore it?"
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backin' this up like "Rewind that"
We're just rollin' with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life livin'
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime, there are those
Who wanna talk this and that, so I suppose
That it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreadin' the dirt, it ​goes

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly
But you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes but hate everyone else's more
I'm ridin' on the back of this pressure
Guessin' that it's better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me somethin' to write on
The pain gave me somethin' I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear
And trash-talkin' and the people it was to
And the people that started it, just like you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly
But you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothin' to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothin' to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain
[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly
But you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening

[Breakdown: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Nobody's listening
Handful of anger held in my chest
Nobody's listening
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nobody's listening
Nothin' to gain, everything to fear
Nobody's listening

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Com-com-com-com-comin' at you
Com-comin', comin', comin', comin' at you
Com-comin', come-com-comin' at
Com-com-com-com-comin' at you from every side



[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
